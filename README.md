#### Recommendations 
- In marketing efforts, highlight the **cost savings** associated with group contracts.  
- Offer **referral discounts** for family and friends to encourage customers to add more members to their group.  
- Target **high-risk clients** (e.g., those with larger monthly bills or nearing the end of their contracts) and encourage them to switch to **group plans** to reduce churn.  
- Encourage longer contract commitments by offering **discounts and loyalty rewards**.  
- Provide **competitive incentives** for group yearly contracts.  
- Identify **low-usage unlimited plan customers** and offer them tailored plans that better match their needs.  
- Provide **incentives for high-usage customers** to stay on unlimited plans through added benefits or loyalty rewards.  
- Improve **communication about plan benefits** to help customers choose the most suitable option.  
- Investigate and address issues with customers using **debit cards and paying monthly**, as they tend to have higher churn rates and frequent customer service calls.  
- Explore offering **more flexible or alternative payment methods** to reduce churn among these groups.  
- Contact customers who have an **international plan but have not made international calls** and propose they downgrade their plan. Offering a cheaper plan with a clear rationale could improve customer satisfaction and reduce churn.  
- Focus on improving **customer service interactions**, particularly for customers who contact support frequently. Providing better service and resolving issues quickly could help reduce churn rates.
